npm init
express
nodemon (updated)
app get, app listen

OK, grundl√¶ggende. Now for all the hard stuff.

1255
setting up the basic html, and public folder structure for express.

1316
util folder for templateEngine

1507
made login form (no functionality yet)

1719
added error-handling to app.listen call of app.js (i THINK so ... i dont know what it would do and i dont know how to cause an error)

1904 2023
1120
seems i need some middleware to populate the body of the request, in order for me ot get the username

can also use js to fetch the data to a post url

1147
ill try using body-parser for getting the form data, so the user can enter their password etc 

import bodyparser
const bodyparser =
etc

1157
finally got the username from the form.
and the password
now for some security

1344
installed bcrypt

1358
alright, now it checks the submitted password.
it should probably look up a user first, tho.

1427
ive made a object w user and pw, and i add the hashed pw to it. for testing.

OK, i got a basic grasp of MongoDB now.

npm i mongodb'd it

2504 2023
0121
i have used urlencodedparser but im starting to think i just should stick to expressjson()

1751
yeah urlendc wasnt needed.
working on getting the new user into the mongodb now.

1816
im having trouble with mongodb -- ill try ot make a function that takes it from the beginning. 

1840
not doing that main function anyway. gonna do it inline in the route

1843
it works,  yesss yeah! user and hashedPW in  the house! in the db, that is.

2704 2023
0234
the routes fall through. cant send more than one header, eh. thats the thing about the setting headers. it means the thing is trying to send more than one res.send --- bereak w return, eh.

0256
im messing w the Post new user route, giving it error codes and trying to see how it might break. i think... i made it so if the db isnt online, the app cant start at all. ill have to test it.

0258
confirm: if i turn off db service, i cannot access server.

0304
it was the order of the instantiations of mongodb. i sorted the try-catch to handle it.
now the server doesnt crash when theres no db, yay.

0307
when running the server now i get a strange error: reference error: collection is not defined.
obv "collection" is my name for a part of mongodbs internal machinery. i think  a collection is what they use to store search results.
anyway ... i think it might be because i had the db turned off when i started the server.
anyway -- i was testing the password/username entry box.

0609
i think maybe the problem is ethe express route expects json and is getting text. ive tried adding a expressusetetx() call as middleware for the route
see, it confused me that the post form of html didnt work, but the postman (which used json) did!
im aware i coulda used express.validator for this (and the error trycatch ive made)

0615
now its giving me a new error -- rangeerror maximum call stack size exceeded, in route .... somethingsomething framework
now im getting an entirely new error ive never seen this before.
here:
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node app.js`
mongodb connection established, from app.js
Server running on port 8080

[nodemon] app crashed - waiting for file changes before starting...

----
that was from a consolelog text ("..blabla") and newUser, from the req.body from html page
--> without the text, it gives me the max call stack size exceeded eror from before.

0623
i tried replacing json() w text() in expressuse 
---> same result

0630
some light googling reveals you can chain ... something? middleware calls? i vaugely recall this from class, but, i mustve missed THAT part of it
ah well. the drums go.

0634
i wrote a small middleware that prints the name of req.body.fullname 
its from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31928417/chaining-multiple-pieces-of-middleware-for-specific-route-in-expressjs

0635
reminder to self: res.send() does nOT behave the same as console.log.

0643
ive read that app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); is deprecated
and i seem to have the problem that SOME of my input is in json and other is in text.
i guess thatsa  multiple route problem, but that seems like an excessive solution.
--> if i paste app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); in as middleware, i get the same max call stack eror again.

0648
i think i made some progress. now i can see the thing. it turns out you CAN have express.urlencoded(etc) as middleware.

0651 
turns out i forgot a } 

0652
ok now it goes through but its still undefined in the insert.

0701
... .... ive been testing on the same html without refreshing it
0x0f

0703
it tricks me,tho -- i have a html form w two fields: name n password. for the name, the express route takes the field named "name"--
but for the pw, express takes the field named "id". what gives? is it a dumbass safety catch?
also these things are case sensitive

0706
still need to trim it etc. input validation

0708 
aaaand we're in. post now works.

1720
tryna get all the info i have in the mongodb -- coz i gotta CHECK if the user name exists, see?
im having some trouble deciphering the DDL, i think ... how to get all the results? It says it returns a cursor ... so how do i progrss?

1729
npm's mongodb page shows it.
const findresult = await coll.find({}).toArray();

1733
gets me all the db items: 
app.get("/all", async (req, res) => { 
    const coll = await collection.find({}).toArray();
    res.send({data: coll})
})

1822
now that i have som db access i need to define separate routes for login and new user signup (obv you cant do both)
2 states: logged in or not
3 actions: log in, create new user or not log in.
create new and log in should both be displayed.

1830
in probably the ugliest html ive ever made, i just copied the new user signup and have it as log in. changed some fields
what can possibly go wrong???
youfool.jpg

1834
i forgot the express urlencoded middleware. testing login fucntion

1837
maybe "name" in the coll.({thnig}) needs tobe in quotes? 
--> nope, no difference

1841
i think its because i forgot about await!
--> bingo! jesus ...

1908
but it gets me ALL the data of one user (incl password) -- not good.
mongo has a projection option as a parameter

1918
i suppose its not a big deal that the db sends the pw to the server... but it sitll bothers me.

1935
finally got it -- turns out you gotta pass an object, and THAT OBJECT has a field "projection", which then HAS AN OBJECT with the projections in it.

2229
im trying to get bcrypt to compare, so i can authorize a user.
when i try to log in, it crashed w error: data and hash arguments required.

2230
its also still intermittently giving me that maxlisteners exceeindgwarning. im starting to worry.

2233 on a hunnch i consolelogd the pw from the post form ,turns it out was undefined. prolly i forgot the middleware

2234
adding a toarray at the coll call didnt help

2239
on a hunch, changed the labels of the forms in html (since i copied them, there might be an errant id somewhere)
i checked the earlier password formr -- it DOES work. signup works -- so why doenst login?

2244 
i tried hardocding the pw ... and it STILL givesme the same erorr.so not only dont i have a pw, i cant compare it either.
perfect

2246
it occurs to me i mightve jsut used an api. i guess... i dont know how to do it. i do, but... eh.
hm.

2313 
i want to set a new git account ... but since my old git acc creds are stored on the path (or something), im having unf trying to push to ANOTHER remote.
i want to like git.
